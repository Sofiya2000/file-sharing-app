# file-sharing-app
I created the File Sharing project as a valuable learning experience. Through this project, I delved into the world of MERN stack development, gaining insights into frontend and backend technologies, as well as database management.

# Key Features 

- File Upload: Users can upload files, which are securely stored in the MongoDB database.
- File Download: Users can download files using unique download links generated for each uploaded file.

# Technologies and libraries Used:

1. Full-stack development using React.js and Node.js/Express.js.
2. Integrating MongoDB for efficient database management.
3. Handling file uploads, downloads, and tracking download counts.
4. Establishing frontend-backend communication via APIs.
5. Leveraging external libraries like Axios, Mongoose, and bcrypt to enhance functionality and security.
